# ViolenceAgainstWomen
Analyzing the causes of violence against women by data mining according to the results of the survey conducted in underdeveloped countries.

##Purpose Of The Study
The aim of this study is to get answers to the following questions:
* Which countries should be supported if an international foundation is established to aid women? Which countries need this?
* What do women and men in the country answer to the question about violence against women? What kind of perspective does he have?
* What is the level of development in Pakistan country I selected?

## About Dataset
The data set from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/violence-against-women-and-girls" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, includes the answers given to the survey conducted in more than 70 countries according to different socioeconomic variables.
These variables are
* Age
* Gender
* Marital Status
* Residence

## About Project
An underdeveloped country (*Pakistan*) was chosen at random and the responses from different socioeconomic levels were graphed.

### Correlation Matrix
Looking at the Correlation Matrix in the code, very strong correlations values with each other are as follows:
* violence_any_reason with violence_argue.
* violence_any_reason with violence_goingout.
* violence_any_reason with violence_neglect.

* violence_argue vs. violence_goingout.
* violence_argue with violence_neglect.

* violence_food with violence_sex.

* violence_goingout with violence_neglect.

* violence_neglect with violence_argue.

## My Analysis
Do you agree or disagree with '*A husband is justified in beating his wife for various reasons?*'  According to the answers to the question,
* As the level of education increases, we can conclude that the husband's reasons for hitting his wife are not justified.
* We can conclude that young individuals *(15-24)* consider the husband's reasons for hitting his wife justified.
* We can conclude that people living in rural areas see their husband's reasons for hitting his wife as justified compared to people living in urban areas.


 ## Conclusion
 As a result, when looking at Pakistan, which is among the 70+ underdeveloped countries included in the dataset, the fact that people have not received or continued education and live in rural areas shows that they justify violence against women for various reasons. As the level of education and development increases, it is observed that the reasons for violence against women are not justified. The research can be expanded by selecting countries other than Pakistan in the Dataset.
